                <p> Honestly I am easy to please. I don't particularly do a lot of things, but many things interest me. A few of my hobbies involve computers. I also am learning to like hiking. When possible, I like to travel. I am learning to like reading books. I love movies, but I am not really in to very many T.V. shows. Click <a href="/main/favorites.php">here</a> for a list of my favorites of these things. </p>
                <h3>Computers</h3> I love computers, obviously :). I love to assemble and dissemble computers on the inside. I like tweaking performance of computers, and cleaning up infected computer. I have been working inside and outside computers since I was 7 years old. I love it all! Usually when I should the reach to point of severe frustration, I persevere and fix the problem. It is a passion of mine. I currently am starting a fund to buy a new desktop PC, I am currently accepting donations ;).
