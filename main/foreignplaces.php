                <h2>Foreign Places I have visited</h2>
                <h3>Brazil 2006</h3>
                <p>In 2006, My Mother, father and I went to Brazil. We extended our trip a little bit and went and stayed with a former exchange students family. We first went to Sao Paulo, then we went to Rio de Janeiro, then we visited Belohorizonte and Sete Lagoas (where our student was from). We stayed for about 11 days ion the country. Here are some pictures of the places we visited there.<br>
