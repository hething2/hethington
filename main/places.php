                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>I like to travel. It is taxing on the body but worth it in the end. I have been to places inside and outside the country. I will say that I like traveling to foreign places, but it is the hardest on the body, and bank account. My family has been blessed with my Mothers job. As a bonus they give her all expense paid for trips for her and some family. These are to places outside of the country. I have been invited to three of six of these trips. The best part is going with family I think. </p>
