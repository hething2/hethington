                <h2>Travelin' USA</h2>
                I haven't been very many places that are mentionable in the US. But despite that fact I enjoyed visiting these places all the same.
                <h3>Nauvoo, IL</h3>
                <p>I went here in 2003 with my family. It was a very memorable trip. We toured the church history areas and I did baptisms for the Dead there.</p>
                <h3>Las Vegas, NV</h3>
                <p>I served my mission here. Though I didn't enjoy the tourist areas while I was there, I appreciate this city, the people I met were amazing.</p>
                <h3>Vacaville, CA</h3>
                <p>I visited here with a friend to see his mission. It is a beautiful city.</p>
                <h3>South Lake Tahoe, CA</h3>
                <p>I served in this area on my mission also. I was an outlying city of a larger area we proselyted in. This really was a beautiful city on Lake Tahoe.</p>
