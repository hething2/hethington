                <h3>How I make close friends closer</h3>
                <p>I love talking to my friends. Same say it is my love language, some say I am social person, some say I am a lot of fun, others think I am plain out obnoxious. I personally think they are all correct. Either way, I try to love everyone I come accrossed. I try to show them respect, and love them as the savior would. I like talking to people about their problems, I geuss I like giving advice. I am a comfortable guy, I will talk to you about anything basically. So that is how I make friends close and dear to me. I talk with them about things that matter, and things that are fun also.</p>
