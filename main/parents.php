                <h3>Mom and Dad</h3>
                <h4>Dad</h4>
                <p>Le Royce Wade Ethington was born in 1949 in Maricopa AZ.
                    My father has always been a good role model to me. He has a good
                    obedient attitude towards commandments and works well with leaders.
                    My father has always been around to be supportive and loving
                    towards his children. He treats his privilege of being a father
                    more as a chance to serve and show large amounts of warm love.</p>
                <h4>Mom</h4>
                <p>Cynthia Anne Smith Ethington was born in 1952 in Boise ID.
                    My mother has always treated people right. She is a wonderful example to
                    me. She taught me from a young age to treat people with love and respect.
                    She is the hardest worker I know. I have learned from my mother how to deal
                    with difficult people. Because of her example I will always find the best in people. <br>
